than or equal to 0.5, we will categorize it as dark. On top of these multiplication and addition operations in each node, we will also apply activation functions. Let's pass this greenish background color through our neural network. We will break this up into three RGB values, which we will then divide by 255, so they are linearly scaled between 0 and 1. We are then going to pass this color through the neural network to make a prediction of a light or dark font. We will pass those first three input values to the first hidden node, and those will substitute the x1, x2, x3 values. And then we will have those three weights we showed earlier. Those weights are fitted using stochastic gradient descent or other optimization techniques that can only be done with thousands of samples of pre-labeled background colors. That process will also calculate the bias value. Finally, we perform that multiplication and addition. We are not done though. We need to take that output and pass it through the
