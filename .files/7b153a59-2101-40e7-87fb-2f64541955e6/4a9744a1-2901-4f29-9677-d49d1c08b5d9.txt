We are going to build a neural network that predicts a light or dark font for a given background color. That will be expressed in RGB values. That will be the input layer. Think of it as a single pixel in an image. The hidden layer will be three nodes containing the way in bias values. And then the output layer will contain the final prediction value. Each input layer node will have a relationship with each hidden layer node, establishing a weight between each one. There will also be a bias value associated with each hidden node. How many hidden layers and the number of nodes in each hidden layer is determined by the specific problem and experimentation. One or more nodes exist in the output layer. In this case, we only have one. That will hold the final prediction. Let's zoom in on that output node. If our prediction is less than 0.5, we will categorize it as light. If it is greater than or equal to 0.5, we will categorize it as dark. On top of these multiplication and addition
