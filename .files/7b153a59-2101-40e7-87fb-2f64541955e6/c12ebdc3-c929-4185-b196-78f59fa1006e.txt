a probability. Recall if our prediction is less than 0.5, it's light. If it's greater than equal to 0.5, it's dark. Well, because our value is 0.843, we will categorize it as dark. Thanks for watching. I hope you enjoyed this video. Chapter 7 of my book Essential Math for Data Science walks through how to create this neural network completely from scratch. This also includes how to solve the way in bias values using stochastic gradient descent and back propagation. Links to the books and animation source code are in the description. See you next time.
