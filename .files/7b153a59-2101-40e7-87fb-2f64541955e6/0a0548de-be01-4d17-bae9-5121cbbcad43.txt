and addition. We are not done though. We need to take that output and pass it through the RayLoo function. The RayLoo function simply takes negative values and turns them to 0. If they are positive, it just leaves the value alone. We repeat this process for every other hidden node. We pass forward the scaled RGB values for that given background color. Those are going to be multiplied with the unique respective weights for that given hidden node associated with each input node. We will also add that bias value, then pass it through the activation function. For this particular color, it may seem that RayLoo is not doing anything because no negative values are coming out of the hidden nodes. That's okay. There are other colors that would. End outputting a negative value would result in a 0. Regarding which activation function to use, RayLoo is common in hidden layers. There are a handful of activation functions to choose from. Some more appropriate for hidden layers. Others more
